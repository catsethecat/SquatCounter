# SquatCounter
Beat Saber squat counter for OBS overlays


- Recommended way to create the overlay is to add a Browser source to OBS and set the URL to http://catse.net/squatcount  
<sup>Tip: You can save that page to disk and use the local file as the URL, that way it'll work offline in case the site goes down sometimes</sup>
- Another option is to add a Text source to OBS, select "Read from file" in its properties and set the file path to `YourBeatSaberFolder\UserData\SquatCount.txt`. This method is not as good since there will be some delay between counter updates
